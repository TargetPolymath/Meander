Text topic identification for automated editing.

OpenAI's GPT-2 Algorithm makes use of attention weights to help narrow the focus of the generation of new text. By tapping that attention, I will create an automatic topic detection and 'segmentation' algorithm which will be able to automatically determine the topical flow of long-form natural language - perhaps a lecture of a professor known for meandering into tangents. By dividing the text into structural sections, sections can be removed or re-ordered to improve the flow of the text in an automated and rapid fashion.
