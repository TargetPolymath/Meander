My spaceship, which I was sent very graciously from the Apple corporation, is called the Cypress. The training for being an astronaut is grueling, and took many years. While I was training, I learned about the quality and strength of humanity - our bond was like brothers. I used my spaceship to get to orbit, where I studied the effects of high-speed acceleration on mice and monkeys. The Apple corporation also makes cup warmers.
